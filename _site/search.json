    "text": "In the era of digital urbanization, city-wide infrastructures, encompassing transportation modes like buses, taxis, and mass transit, have undergone significant digitization. This transformation has yielded extensive datasets that serve as a fundamental framework for monitoring movement patterns across both space and time. This shift is particularly evident with the widespread adoption of pervasive computing technologies, including GPS and RFID, notably integrated into vehicles. For instance, the utilization of smart cards and GPS devices on public buses enables the collection of comprehensive data on routes and ridership. Within these vast datasets lie inherent structures and patterns that offer valuable insights into the characteristics of measured phenomena, providing a deeper understanding of human movement and behaviors within urban environments. The identification, analysis, and comparison of these patterns present opportunities for enhanced urban management, offering valuable information for both public and private urban transport service providers. Despite these possibilities, current practices often restrict the use of massive locational data to basic tracking and mapping through Geographic Information System (GIS) applications. This limitation arises from the insufficient capabilities of conventional GIS in effectively analyzing and modeling spatial and spatio-temporal data."

The âgrid_idâ values are assigned incrementally, starting from 1 and corresponding to the order of the hexagons in the grid. This step essentially assigns a unique identifier to each hexagon in the grid, facilitating further spatial analysis or mapping.\n\n\nShow the code\nhexagon = st_make_grid(busstop, c(250, 250), what = \"polygons\", square = FALSE)\n\n# To sf and add grid ID\nhexagon_sf = st_sf(hexagon) %&gt;%\n  # add grid ID\n  mutate(grid_id = 1:length(lengths(hexagon)))\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nduplicates &lt;- hexagon_sf[duplicated(hexagon_sf$grid_id), ]\n\n# Check if there are any duplicates\nif (nrow(duplicates) &gt; 0) {\n  cat(\"Duplicate values found in the grid_id column.\\n\")\n  print(duplicates)\n} else {\n  cat(\"No duplicate values found in the grid_id column.\\n\")\n}\n\n\nNo duplicate values found in the grid_id column.\n\n\n\n\nExamine The Grid\nA brief overplot shows that there are 22134 grids in total and 19003 are without bus stops.

We specify break points at 0,1,2,3,4 and 5\nFrom the map below, it is obvious that most hexagons have 1 or 2 bus stops in their grid with some having 4 or 5 bus stops. There is approximately one âclusterâ that are close to each other and having 4 or 5 bus stops in each region in North, East, South, West.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\nmap_busstopcounts = tm_shape(hexagon_sf) +\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"n_colli\",\n    palette = c(\"grey\",rev(viridis(5))),\n    breaks = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n    title = \"Number of Busstops\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    popup.vars = c(\n      \"Number of collisions: \" = \"n_colli\"\n    ),\n    popup.format = list(\n      n_colli = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0)\n    )\n  ) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7)\n\nmap_busstopcounts\n\n\n\n\n\nA few notable findings were:\n\nIn the North-West, bus stops are scarce around the cemetery in Choa Chu Kang, the nearest bus stops in that area are those along Lim Chu Kang road.

Geovisualisation and Analysis\n\nImportant Considerations\n\nDue to the use of small hexagon tiles and a heavily right skewed distribution, quantile classification proves to provide little value. We decided that kmeans classification is best due to the ability to create discrete classes. This helps us to compare the 4 periods easily.\nWe previously derived number of Passenger Trips using the bus stops as the origin. This means that that some tiles could have missing data due to the lack of trips originating from there but that not necessary be the case for trips with that as the destination.\nWe previously excluded tiles with no bus stops earlier in hexagon_sf, hence any missing data present here is not due to missing bus stops\n\n\n\nGeneral Observations across all 4 interval classifications\n\nThe bus stops along Lim Chu Kang exhibit minimal to no origin trips on both weekdays and weekends. This can be attributed to the presence of a cemetery in that area, making it more practical for individuals to use private transportation.\nAdditionally, along the eastern coast, there are several bus stops without origin trips on weekdays. However, the situation changes on weekends and holidays, although the overall volume remains low. It is advisable to consider adjusting the bus schedule in that region for weekdays. A similar pattern is observed for the islands in the North-West..\nOrigin Trips for a few bus stops near the customs remain high through weekdays and wekends. Also, one bus stop in Johor is consistently high in origin trips.\nIn central areas, origin trips are not high during weekday mornings but are high during weekday afternoons. This is probably due to residential planning by the URA where residents travel from the other regions to the central and business districts.\n\n\nWeekday Morning PeakWeekday Afternoon PeakWeekend/holiday Morning PeakWeekend/holiday Evening Peak\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ninferno_palette &lt;- inferno(5)\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekday_morning_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\", \n          palette = viridis(5),\n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekday morning peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2)+\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekday_afternoon_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\", \n          palette = viridis(5),\n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekday afternoon peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2)+\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekend_morning_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\", \n          palette = viridis(5),\n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekend/holiday morning peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2)+\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekend_evening_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\",\n          palette = viridis(5), \n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekend/holiday evening peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")"

    "text": "5. Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) Analysis\nLocal Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) Analysis:\nLocal Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) is a statistical technique used in spatial analysis to identify and assess spatial patterns of clustering or dispersion within a geographical dataset. LISA analysis helps to uncover local patterns of spatial autocorrelation, providing insights into whether similar values tend to cluster together or if there are areas with dissimilar values.\nLISA analysis is based on the concept of spatial autocorrelation, which measures the degree to which neighboring locations are similar or dissimilar in terms of a particular variable. (In Our case, it is Origin Passenger Trips)\nTwo key LISA statistics are Moranâs I and the associated p-value, for each spatial unit (hexagon grid in our case) to determine if they are part of a significant cluster, outlier, or exhibit no significant pattern.\nLocal Moranâs I identifies clusters by categorizing each unit as High-High (high value surrounded by high values), Low-Low (low value surrounded by low values), High-Low (high value surrounded by low values), or Low-High (low value surrounded by high values).\n- Decision-making process\nDue to the use of hexagon grids, we had many empty grids and this proves difficult to derive contiguity weights. Hence, we attempted to derive distance weights instead\nFixed distance weight matrix was used in deriving the weights and neighbors.\n\n5.1 Deriving adaptive distance weights\nThe summary statistics report below shows that the maximum nearest neighbour distance is 901.4m.

The chosen tmap_style option is set to albatross to suit the gridâs nature and emphasize clusters, where lighter colors indicate positive values and darker colors indicate negative values.\nItâs important to note that a positive Local Moranâs I value signifies a featureâs membership in a cluster, while a negative value suggests that a feature is an outlier.\nExamining the map, regions shaded in various hues of green indicate their membership in one or more clusters.While there are overlapping areas among the maps generated for the four periods of interest, there are also discrepancies.\nHowever, relying solely on the local Moranâs score is insufficient for depicting spatial clustering, as it doesnât provide information about whether the variableâs value (Total Passenger Trips) being examined is high or low, and whether the test result is statistically significant. We need to proceed with analyzing only the regions with statistically significant values of total passenger trips.\n\n5.3.1 Weekday Morning Peak5.3.2 Weekday Afternoon Peak5.3.3 Weekend Morning Peak5.3.4 Weekend Afternoon Peak\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_1) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekday morning\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_2) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekday afternoon\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_3) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekend morning\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_4) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekend afternoon\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Visualising p-value of local Moranâs I\nIn the code chunk below, tmap functions are used to prepare a choropleth map by using value in the p_ii_sim field\nWe will visualize solely the statistically significant local Moranâs I values (p_ii_sim &lt; 0.05) through the subsequent code snippet.\n\n5.4.1 Weekday Morning Peak5.4.2 Weekday Afternoon Peak5.4.3 Weekend Morning Peak5.4.4 Weekend Afternoon Peak\n\n\nComparing local Moranâs I together with its p_ii_sim values, a few observations were revealed:\n\nThere are clusters near customs and throughout most of west area. They are all statistically significant.\nClusters and dispersions found in the South / Central are mostly not statistically significant and should be ignored.\nThere are both many clusters and dispersions found in Bedok, Tampines, Pasir Ris and Changi that are found to be statistically significant. However, not so much for other parts of East.\nClusters and Dispersions found in North east and North are also statistically significant.\n\nThese Clusters found seem to match our expectations as they are within residential zones. However, this is possible also because of bus interchanges and the wider options of buses avaliable near these bus interchanges.\nWhat about the dispersion that we are observing? It is easy to dismiss that. However they tend to happen around those clusters found. This can actually be explained with the fact that are OTHER options other than taking buses such as a little bit of walk orâ¦. Cycling!!! as a form of commuting.\nThis trend may not be immediately apparent to individuals who donât utilize public transportation or to foreigners. However, itâs becoming increasingly common for Singaporeans to use personal transport, such as bicycles, to reach bus interchanges instead of waiting for buses directly at their residences. This choice is driven by the realization that cycling to the bus interchange can be a more time-efficient option. The areas surrounding bus interchanges often face congestion with numerous bus stops and traffic lights, turning what should be a short journey into a lengthy one.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_1) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",\n          palette = c(rev(viridis(5)), \"grey\"),\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\")) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"p-value of local Moran I in weekday morning\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"watercolor\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are few dispersions this time round and more clusters found instead.\nMost of previously residential areas identified are found to not display any statistically significant patterns, other than some parts around tampines and north east which could be hubs designated by the government.\nMany statistically significant clusters are found around west region which is also an industrial region.\nCentral business district areas do not exhibit any significant patterns, it seems most office workers do not take buses home but the MRT instead.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_2) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",\n          palette = c(rev(viridis(5)), \"grey\"),\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\")) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"p-value of local Moran I in weekday afternoon\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"watercolor\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems there are more dispersions during mornings peak hours even for weekends/holidays.\nThere are less clusters as compared to weekdays. The most significant clusters are those found around Bugis and Lavender.\nClusters found near NUS are statistically significant, it is unsure if it is due to the school itself.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_3) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",\n          palette = c(rev(viridis(5)), \"grey\"),\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\")) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"p-value of local Moran I in weekend morning\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"watercolor\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are very few dispersions this time round, with three in Johor, this is not surprising as any Singapore would understand that most wonât choose that time to travel back to Singapore and this data only record trips between Singapore bus stops and does not include trips not under SBS.\nMore clusters are shown and are quite concentrated as compared to weekdays.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_4) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",\n          palette = c(rev(viridis(5)), \"grey\"),\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\")) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"p-value of local Moran I in weekend afternoon\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"watercolor\")"

Hence, we performed the following steps:\n\nIn order to derive its spatial features represented in the new_georeferenced_column_, we use the st_as_sfc() function of sf package to derive a new field called Geometry.\nNext, st_sf() will be used to convert the tibble data frame into sf data frame geo-referenced to Projected Coordinate Systems of Nigeria using EPSG: 26391.\nWe save our processed data into .rds data format files using theÂ write_rds()Â ofÂ readrÂ package.

Our task in this study, hence, is to apply appropriate spatial statistical methods to discover if development are even distributed geographically. If the answer is No. Then, our next question will be âis there sign of spatial clustering?â. And, if the answer for this question is yes, then our next question will be âwhere are these clusters?â\nIn this case study, we are interested to examine the spatial pattern of a selected development indicator (i.e.Â GDP per capita) of Hunan Provice, People Republic of China.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan)\n\n\n3.2.2 The Study Area and Data\nTwo data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:\n\nHunan province administrative boundary layer at county level.

    "section": "3.4 Global Spatial Autocorrelation",
    "text": "3.4 Global Spatial Autocorrelation\nIn this section, you will learn how to compute global spatial autocorrelation statistics and to perform spatial complete randomness test for global spatial autocorrelation.\n\n3.4.1 Computing Contiguity Spatial Weights\nBefore we can compute the global spatial autocorrelation statistics, we need to construct a spatial weights of the study area. The spatial weights is used to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e.Â county) in the study area.\nIn the code chunk below, poly2nb() of spdep package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. If you look at the documentation you will see that you can pass a âqueenâ argument that takes TRUE or FALSE as options. If you do not specify this argument the default is set to TRUE, that is, if you donât specify queen = FALSE this function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria.\nMore specifically, the code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix.\n\nwm_q &lt;- poly2nb(hunan, queen=TRUE) \nsummary(wm_q)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\n\nThe summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one neighbours.\n\n\n3.4.2 Row-standardised weights matrix\nNext, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=âWâ). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summaries the neighborsâ values it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, weâll stick with the style=âWâ option for simplicityâs sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=âBâ.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, style=\"W\", zero.policy = TRUE) \nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\nThe input of nb2listw() must be an object of class nb. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.poly.\n\nstyle can take values âWâ, âBâ, âCâ, âUâ, âminmaxâ and âSâ. B is the basic binary coding, W is row standardised (sums over all links to n), C is globally standardised (sums over all links to n), U is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity), while S is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al.Â 1999, p.Â 167-168 (sums over all links to n).\nIf zero policy is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Global Spatial Autocorrelation: Moranâs I\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform Moranâs I statistics testing by using moran.test() of spdep.\n\n\n3.4.4 Maronâs I test\nThe code chunk below performs Moranâs I statistical testing using moran.test() of spdep.\n\nmoran.test(hunan$GDPPC,listw=rswm_q, zero.policy = TRUE,na.action=na.omit)\n\n\n    Moran I test under randomisation\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC  \nweights: rswm_q    \n\nMoran I statistic standard deviate = 4.7351, p-value = 1.095e-06\nalternative hypothesis: greater\nsample estimates:\nMoran I statistic       Expectation          Variance \n      0.300749970      -0.011494253       0.004348351 \n\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above? In summary there is a statistically significant positive spatial autocorrelation in the GDP per capita variable among the regions, meaning that regions with similar economic characteristics are spatially clustered.\n\n\n3.4.4.1 Computing Monte Carlo Moranâs I\nThe code chunk below performs permutation test for Moranâs I statistic by using moran.mc() of spdep. A total of 1000 simulation will be performed.\n\nset.seed(1234) \nbperm= moran.mc(hunan$GDPPC, listw=rswm_q, nsim=999, zero.policy= TRUE,na.action=na.omit) \nbperm\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC \nweights: rswm_q  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.30075, observed rank = 1000, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclustion can you draw fro mthe output above?\n\n\nstatistic = 0.30075 is more than 0 =&gt; Clustered, observations tend to be similar In summary, the Monte Carlo simulation provides robust evidence that the spatial autocorrelation observed in the GDP per capita variable is unlikely to be due to random chance, supporting the conclusion drawn from the Moranâs I test.\n\n\n\n3.4.4.2 Visualising Monte Carlo Moranâs I\nIt is always a good practice for us the examine the simulated Moranâs I test statistics in greater detail. This can be achieved by plotting the distribution of the statistical values as a histogram by using the code chunk below.\nIn the code chunk below hist() and abline() of R Graphics are used.\n\nmean(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] -0.01504572\n\n\n\nvar(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] 0.004371574\n\n\n\nsummary(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n    Min.  1st Qu.

The histogram is slightly skewed to the right which confirms the result of Maronâs I test (Moran I statistic of 0.300749970, there is some clustering of similar value)\n\n\nChallenge: Instead of using Base Graph to plot the values, plot the values by using ggplot2 package.\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Extract simulated Moran's I values excluding the observed value\nsimulated_values &lt;- bperm$res[1:999]\n\n# Create a ggplot histogram\nggplot(data = data.frame(Moran_I = bperm$res), aes(x = Moran_I)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Simulated Moran's I\",\n       x = \"Simulated Moran's I\",\n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Global Spatial Autocorrelation: Gearyâs\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform Gearyâs c statistics testing by using appropriate functions of spdep package.\n\n3.4.5.1 Gearyâs C test\nThe code chunk below performs Gearyâs C test for spatial autocorrelation by using geary.test() of spdep.\n\ngeary.test(hunan$GDPPC, listw=rswm_q)\n\n\n    Geary C test under randomisation\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC \nweights: rswm_q \n\nGeary C statistic standard deviate = 3.6108, p-value = 0.0001526\nalternative hypothesis: Expectation greater than statistic\nsample estimates:\nGeary C statistic       Expectation          Variance \n        0.6907223         1.0000000         0.0073364 \n\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above?\n\n\nThe p-value is very small (0.0001526), indicating that the observed spatial pattern in GDPPC is statistically significant. The Geary C statistic being less than 1 suggests positive spatial autocorrelation, signifying clustering The observed value of Gearyâs C is significantly lower than the expected value under spatial randomness, supporting the conclusion of positive spatial autocorrelation.\n\n\n\n3.4.5.2 Computing Monte Carlo Gearyâs C\nThe code chunk below performs permutation test for Gearyâs C statistic by using geary.mc() of spdep.\n\nset.seed(1234) \nbperm=geary.mc(hunan$GDPPC, listw=rswm_q,nsim=999) \nbperm\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Geary C\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC \nweights: rswm_q \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.69072, observed rank = 1, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above?\n\n\nThe p-value of 0.001 is less than the conventional significance level of 0.05, indicating that the observed Gearyâs C statistic is statistically significant. The alternative hypothesis is that the expectation is greater than the observed statistic, suggesting a positive spatial autocorrelation. The observed Gearyâs C value of 0.69072 is consistent with positive spatial autocorrelation, and the small p-value reinforces the evidence against the null hypothesis of spatial randomness. In summary, the statistical evidence from the Monte Carlo simulation supports the conclusion that there is a significant positive spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of GDPPC values in the study area.\n\n\n\n3.4.5.3 Visualising the Monte Carlo Gearyâs C\nNext, we will plot a histogram to reveal the distribution of the simulated values by using the code chunk below.\n\nmean(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] 1.004402\n\n\n\nvar(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] 0.007436493\n\n\n\nsummary(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

    "text": "3.5 Spatial Correlogram\nSpatial correlograms are great to examine patterns of spatial autocorrelation in your data or model residuals.

    "text": "13.7 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nIn the section, you will learn how to use statistical graphics functions of ggplot2 package to perform EDA.\n\n13.7.1 EDA using statistical graphics\nWe can plot the distribution of SELLING_PRICE by using appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above reveals a right skewed distribution. This means that more condominium units were transacted at relative lower prices.\nStatistically, the skewed dsitribution can be normalised by using log transformation. The code chunk below is used to derive a new variable called LOG_SELLING_PRICE by using a log transformation on the variable SELLING_PRICE. It is performed using mutate() of dplyr package.\n\ncondo_resale.sf &lt;- condo_resale.sf %&gt;%\n  mutate(`LOG_SELLING_PRICE` = log(SELLING_PRICE))\n\nNow, you can plot the LOG_SELLING_PRICE using the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x=`LOG_SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution is relatively less skewed after the transformation.\n\n\n13.7.2 Multiple Histogram Plots distribution of variables\nIn this section, you will learn how to draw a small multiple histograms (also known as trellis plot) by using ggarrange() of ggpubr package.\nThe code chunk below is used to create 12 histograms.

The map will be prepared by using tmap package.\nFirst, we will turn on the interactive mode of tmap by using the code chunk below.\nNext, the code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\n# tmap_mode(\"view\")\n# tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n#   tm_polygons() +\n# tm_shape(condo_resale.sf) +  \n#   tm_dots(col = \"SELLING_PRICE\",\n#           alpha = 0.6,\n#           style=\"quantile\") +\n#   tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nNotice that tm_dots() is used instead of tm_bubbles().\nset.zoom.limits argument of tm_view() sets the minimum and maximum zoom level to 11 and 14 respectively."

The explanatory variables are origin population by different age cohort, destination population by different age cohort (i.e.Â ORIGIN_AGE25_64) and distance between origin and destination in km (i.e.Â dist).\nThe general formula of Unconstrained Spatial Interaction Model\nThe code chunk used to calibrate to model is shown below:\n\nuncSIM &lt;- glm(formula = TRIPS ~ \n                log(ORIGIN_AGE25_64) + \n                log(DESTIN_AGE25_64) +\n                log(dist),\n              family = poisson(link = \"log\"),\n              data = SIM_data,\n              na.action = na.exclude)\nuncSIM\n\n\nCall:  glm(formula = TRIPS ~ log(ORIGIN_AGE25_64) + log(DESTIN_AGE25_64) + \n    log(dist), family = poisson(link = \"log\"), data = SIM_data, \n    na.action = na.exclude)\n\nCoefficients:\n         (Intercept)  log(ORIGIN_AGE25_64)  log(DESTIN_AGE25_64)  \n            17.00287               0.21001               0.01289  \n           log(dist)  \n            -1.51785  \n\nDegrees of Freedom: 14273 Total (i.e. Null);  14270 Residual\nNull Deviance:      36120000 \nResidual Deviance: 19960000     AIC: 20040000\n\n\n\n\n16.8.5 R-squared function\nIn order to measure how much variation of the trips can be accounted by the model we will write a function to calculate R-Squared value as shown below.\n\nCalcRSquared &lt;- function(observed,estimated){\n  r &lt;- cor(observed,estimated)\n  R2 &lt;- r^2\n  R2\n}\n\nNext, we will compute the R-squared of the unconstrained SIM by using the code chunk below.\n\nCalcRSquared(uncSIM$data$TRIPS, uncSIM$fitted.values)\n\n[1] 0.1694734\n\n\n\nr2_mcfadden(uncSIM)\n\n# R2 for Generalized Linear Regression\n       R2: 0.446\n  adj.

    "text": "What are the driving forces behind urban dwellers to weak up early in morning to commute from their home locations to their work places? What are the impact of removing a public bus service on the commuters reside along the corridor of the bus route? These and many other questions related to urban mobility are challenges faced by transport operators and urban managers.\nTo provide answer to this question, traditionally, commuters survey will be used. However, commuters survey is a very costly, time-consuming and laborous, not to mention that the survey data tend to take a long time to clean and analyse. As a result, it is not unusual, by the time the survey report was ready, most of the information already out-of-date!\nAs city-wide urban infrastructures such as public buses, mass rapid transits, public utilities and roads become digital, the data sets obtained can be used as a framework for tracking movement patterns through space and time. This is particularly true with the recent trend of massive deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as GPS on the vehicles and SMART cards used by public transport commuters.\nUnfortunately, this explosive growth of geospatially-referenced data has far outpaced the plannerâs ability to utilize and transform the data into insightful information thus creating an adverse impact on the return on the investment made to collect and manage this data."
