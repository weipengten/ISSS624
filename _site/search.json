The output file is saved in rds sub-folder. We do this to reduce the loading time and more importantly, we can avoid uploading the large raw files onto GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nData is Clean!\nNot surprisingly, there are also no duplicates and missing data for Bus stop Data.

The “grid_id” values are assigned incrementally, starting from 1 and corresponding to the order of the hexagons in the grid. This step essentially assigns a unique identifier to each hexagon in the grid, facilitating further spatial analysis or mapping.\n\n\nShow the code\nhexagon = st_make_grid(busstop, c(250, 250), what = \"polygons\", square = FALSE)\n\n# To sf and add grid ID\nhexagon_sf = st_sf(hexagon) %&gt;%\n  # add grid ID\n  mutate(grid_id = 1:length(lengths(hexagon)))\n\n\n\n\nExamine The Grid\nA brief overplot shows that there are 22134 grids in total and 19003 are without bus stops.

We specify break points at 0,1,2,3,4 and 5\nFrom the map below, it is obvious that most hexagons have 1 or 2 bus stops in their grid with some having 4 or 5 bus stops. There is approximately one ‘cluster’ that are close to each other and having 4 or 5 bus stops in each region in North, East, South, West.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\nmap_busstopcounts = tm_shape(hexagon_sf) +\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"n_colli\",\n    palette = c(\"grey\",rev(viridis(5))),\n    breaks = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n    title = \"Number of Busstops\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    popup.vars = c(\n      \"Number of collisions: \" = \"n_colli\"\n    ),\n    popup.format = list(\n      n_colli = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0)\n    )\n  ) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7)\n\nmap_busstopcounts\n\n\n\n\n\nA few notable findings were:\n\nIn the North-West, bus stops are scarce around the cemetery in Choa Chu Kang, the nearest bus stops in that area are those along Lim Chu Kang road. Tengah Airbase is also located in that area.\nAt the far East, bus stops are scarce around Changi Airport\n- “grid_id” = 22027 is an extreme outlier, we will need to drop it\nTowards the middle, we have Paya Lebar Airbase\nIn the middle, we have the Central Water Catchment\nA standalone bus stop in Sentosa Island\n- “grid_id” = 11471 is a potential outlier and should be considered for exclusion\nA few bus stops in Johor are surprisingly in our dataset too and in\n- “grid_id” = 7068 is an extreme outlier, we will need to drop it.\n- “grid_id” for 8113,8237,8351,8485 are potential outliers as well\nOther than those mentioned above, the positioning of the rest of the bus stops seem to be acceptable and will not skew our dataset too much.\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\nHence, let’s proceed straight to dropping these data that will likely cause problems for our analysis. After deeper consideration, we decided that we should drop grid_ids for 22027, 11471 and 7068\n\n\nShow the code\n# Combine Busstop and Hexagon\nhexagon_sf &lt;- hexagon_sf %&gt;%\n  filter(!grid_id %in% c(22027, 11471, 7068))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe needed to perform aggregation of passenger trips by Hexagon instead of Origin Bus Stop, hence we need to first integrate bus stop data and the hexagon dataset using the st_intersection function from the sf package. The intersection operation retains only the spatial elements (points) that overlap between the original bus stop locations and the hexagonal grid.The resulting busstop_hexagon dataset contains information about which hexagon grid each bus stop is located in.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Combine Busstop and Hexagon\nbusstop_hexagon &lt;- st_intersection(busstop, hexagon_sf) %&gt;%\n  select(BUS_STOP_N, grid_id) %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry\n\n\nHowever, it is found that there were duplicates:\n- Some bus stops were found to be in multiple grids, this is illogical and should be dropped from analysis.\n-   Example: BUS_STOP 250559 appeared both in grid 4 and 128\n- However it is also found out that are some duplicate entries of bus stops despite showing the same grid_id, this could lead to double counting\n-   Example: BUS_STOP 22501 appeared both with the same grid as 4796\n\n\nShow the code\nduplicate &lt;- busstop_hexagon %&gt;%\n  group_by(BUS_STOP_N) %&gt;%\n  filter(n()&gt;1) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\nduplicate\n\n\n# A tibble: 34 × 2\n   BUS_STOP_N grid_id\n   &lt;chr&gt;

Geovisualisation and Analysis\n\nImportant Considerations\n\nDue to the use of small hexagon tiles and a heavily right skewed distribution, quantile classification proves to provide little value. We decided that kmeans classification is best due to the ability to create discrete classes. This helps us to compare the 4 periods easily.\nWe previously derived number of Passenger Trips using the bus stops as the origin. This means that that some tiles could have missing data due to the lack of trips originating from there but that not necessary be the case for trips with that as the destination.\nWe previously excluded tiles with no bus stops earlier in hexagon_sf, hence any missing data present here is not due to missing bus stops\n\n\n\nGeneral Observations across all 4 interval classifications\n\nThe bus stops along Lim Chu Kang exhibit minimal to no origin trips on both weekdays and weekends. This can be attributed to the presence of a cemetery in that area, making it more practical for individuals to use private transportation.\nAdditionally, along the eastern coast, there are several bus stops without origin trips on weekdays. However, the situation changes on weekends and holidays, although the overall volume remains low. It is advisable to consider adjusting the bus schedule in that region for weekdays. A similar pattern is observed for the islands in the North-West..\nOrigin Trips for a few bus stops near the customs remain high through weekdays and wekends. Also, one bus stop in Johor is consistently high in origin trips.\nIn central areas, origin trips are not high during weekday mornings but are high during weekday afternoons. This is probably due to residential planning by the URA where residents travel from the other regions to the central and business districts.\n\n\nWeekday Morning PeakWeekday Afternoon PeakWeekend/holiday Morning PeakWeekend/holiday Evening Peak\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ninferno_palette &lt;- inferno(5)\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekday_morning_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\", \n          palette = viridis(5),\n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekday morning peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2)+\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekday_afternoon_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\", \n          palette = viridis(5),\n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekday afternoon peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2)+\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekend_morning_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\", \n          palette = viridis(5),\n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekend/holiday morning peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2)+\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\ntm_shape(weekend_evening_peak_join_geometry)+\n  tm_fill(\"TOT_TRIPS\", \n          style = \"kmeans\",\n          palette = viridis(5), \n          title = \"Passenger trips\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Passenger trips during Weekend/holiday evening peak\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tmap_style(\"natural\")"

    "text": "5. Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) Analysis\nLocal Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) Analysis:\nLocal Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) is a statistical technique used in spatial analysis to identify and assess spatial patterns of clustering or dispersion within a geographical dataset. LISA analysis helps to uncover local patterns of spatial autocorrelation, providing insights into whether similar values tend to cluster together or if there are areas with dissimilar values.\nLISA analysis is based on the concept of spatial autocorrelation, which measures the degree to which neighboring locations are similar or dissimilar in terms of a particular variable. (In Our case, it is Origin Passenger Trips)\nTwo key LISA statistics are Moran’s I and the associated p-value, for each spatial unit (hexagon grid in our case) to determine if they are part of a significant cluster, outlier, or exhibit no significant pattern.\nLocal Moran’s I identifies clusters by categorizing each unit as High-High (high value surrounded by high values), Low-Low (low value surrounded by low values), High-Low (high value surrounded by low values), or Low-High (low value surrounded by high values).\n- Decision-making process\nDue to the use of hexagon grids, we had many empty grids and this proves difficult to derive contiguity weights. Hence, we attempted to derive distance weights instead\nFixed distance weight matrix was used in deriving the weights and neighbors.\n\n5.1 Deriving adaptive distance weights\nThe summary statistics report below shows that the maximum nearest neighbour distance is 901.4m. By using a threshold value of 902m will ensure that each area will have at least one neighbour.\n\n\nShow the code\ngeo &lt;- sf::st_geometry(hexagon_sf)\nnb &lt;- st_knn(geo, longlat = TRUE)\ndists &lt;- unlist(st_nb_dists(geo, nb))\nsummary(dists)\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

The chosen tmap_style option is set to albatross to suit the grid’s nature and emphasize clusters, where lighter colors indicate positive values and darker colors indicate negative values.\nIt’s important to note that a positive Local Moran’s I value signifies a feature’s membership in a cluster, while a negative value suggests that a feature is an outlier.\nExamining the map, regions shaded in various hues of green indicate their membership in one or more clusters.While there are overlapping areas among the maps generated for the four periods of interest, there are also discrepancies.\nHowever, relying solely on the local Moran’s score is insufficient for depicting spatial clustering, as it doesn’t provide information about whether the variable’s value (Total Passenger Trips) being examined is high or low, and whether the test result is statistically significant. We need to proceed with analyzing only the regions with statistically significant values of total passenger trips.\n\n5.3.1 Weekday Morning Peak5.3.2 Weekday Afternoon Peak5.3.3 Weekend Morning Peak5.3.4 Weekend Afternoon Peak\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_1) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekday morning\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_2) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekday afternoon\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_3) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekend morning\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_4) +\n  tm_fill(\"ii\",\n          style = \"kmeans\",\n         palette = viridis(5)) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"local Moran I of Bus Trips in weekend afternoon\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"albatross\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Visualising p-value of local Moran’s I\nIn the code chunk below, tmap functions are used to prepare a choropleth map by using value in the p_ii_sim field\nWe will visualize solely the statistically significant local Moran’s I values (p_ii_sim &lt; 0.05) through the subsequent code snippet.\n\n5.4.1 Weekday Morning Peak5.4.2 Weekday Afternoon Peak5.4.3 Weekend Morning Peak5.4.4 Weekend Afternoon Peak\n\n\nComparing local Moran’s I together with its p_ii_sim values, a few observations were revealed:\n\nThere are clusters near customs and throughout most of west area. They are all statistically significant.\nClusters and dispersions found in the South / Central are mostly not statistically significant and should be ignored.\nThere are both many clusters and dispersions found in Bedok, Tampines, Pasir Ris and Changi that are found to be statistically significant. However, not so much for other parts of East.\nClusters and Dispersions found in North east and North are also statistically significant.\n\nThese Clusters found seem to match our expectations as they are within residential zones. However, this is possible also because of bus interchanges and the wider options of buses avaliable near these bus interchanges.\nWhat about the dispersion that we are observing? It is easy to dismiss that. However they tend to happen around those clusters found. This can actually be explained with the fact that are OTHER options other than taking buses such as a little bit of walk or…. Cycling!!! as a form of commuting.\nThis trend may not be immediately apparent to individuals who don’t utilize public transportation or to foreigners. However, it’s becoming increasingly common for Singaporeans to use personal transport, such as bicycles, to reach bus interchanges instead of waiting for buses directly at their residences. This choice is driven by the realization that cycling to the bus interchange can be a more time-efficient option. The areas surrounding bus interchanges often face congestion with numerous bus stops and traffic lights, turning what should be a short journey into a lengthy one.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_1) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",\n          palette = c(rev(viridis(5)), \"grey\"),\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\")) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"p-value of local Moran I in weekday morning\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"watercolor\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are few dispersions this time round and more clusters found instead.\nMost of previously residential areas identified are found to not display any statistically significant patterns, other than some parts around tampines and north east which could be hubs designated by the government.\nMany statistically significant clusters are found around west region which is also an industrial region.\nCentral business district areas do not exhibit any significant patterns, it seems most office workers do not take buses home but the MRT instead.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_2) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",\n          palette = c(rev(viridis(5)), \"grey\"),\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\")) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"p-value of local Moran I in weekday afternoon\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"watercolor\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems there are more dispersions during mornings peak hours even for weekends/holidays.\nThere are less clusters as compared to weekdays. The most significant clusters are those found around Bugis and Lavender.\nClusters found near NUS are statistically significant, it is unsure if it is due to the school itself.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_3) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",\n          palette = c(rev(viridis(5)), \"grey\"),\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\")) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"p-value of local Moran I in weekend morning\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"watercolor\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are very few dispersions this time round, with three in Johor, this is not surprising as any Singapore would understand that most won’t choose that time to travel back to Singapore and this data only record trips between Singapore bus stops and does not include trips not under SBS.\nMore clusters are shown and are quite concentrated as compared to weekdays.\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(lisa_4) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",\n          palette = c(rev(viridis(5)), \"grey\"),\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\")) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"p-value of local Moran I in weekend afternoon\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8) +\n  tmap_style(\"watercolor\")"
